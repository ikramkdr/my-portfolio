# 🕹️ Retro-Themed Portfolio

This portfolio is not just a collection of projects and skills—it’s a playful experience! You can navigate it like a retro game, progressing through levels filled with animations, sounds, and pixel art. Or, if you prefer, you can jump straight to a quick résumé view for a faster look at the essentials.

The design draws inspiration from classic 8-bit RPG games and a beautiful Figma concept by Jayendra AWASTHI, blending nostalgia with modern web technologies to create a unique storytelling journey through a developer’s career.
